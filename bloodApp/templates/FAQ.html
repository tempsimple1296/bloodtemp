          <u><h3> Is there any danger in donating blood?</h3></u>

        <div class="col-lg-4">
          <u><h3>Will I get AIDS?</h3></u>
          <p>Absolutely not! All equipments used to collect blood are sterile. These items are used once and discarded. Blood collections are performed by professionally trained blood bank personnel whose primary concern is your safety and the safety of the blood to be transfused.</p>
        </div>
	<div class="col-lg-4">

<div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-4">
          <u><h3>Why do I have to wait for three months before donating again?</h3></u>
          <p>Since blood contains iron (which is essential for making new red blood cells), donating blood more often than every 3 months causes the body to lose iron faster than it can be made up from iron-containing foods in our diet. As a result the donor could develop iron deficiency anemia, causing him/her to feel weak and tired.</p>
          </div>
	<div class="col-lg-4">
          <u><h3>I suffer from diabetes, Can i Still Donate Blood?</h3></u>
          <p>Yes one can still donate blood if you are on oral medication for diabetes and are not insulin-dependent, you are a good candidate to donate blood. All you need to do is keep a few of these parameters in mind before you donate. You should not have donated blood for at least 56 days, and  should be generally healthy. If you suffer from high blood pressure or any other heart disease, make sure to consult your doctor before you donate blood.</p>
          </div>

	<div class="col-lg-4">
		  <u><h3>What if I faint?</h3></u>

          </div>
        
        <div class="col-lg-4">
          <u><h3>Will I become weak if I donate frequently?</h3></u>
